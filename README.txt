# LLMacro

LLMacro uses low-level input sending via C++, allowing it to bypass security measures in programs and games.
The program enables the creation of bots and automation of processes that would normally be performed by the user.

The creator of the program is not responsible for any consequences arising from the use of LLMacro in programs that prohibit such use.
